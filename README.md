1.This project demonstrates the application of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering using the fcmeans library on the Iris dataset. 
The code visualizes how the algorithm clusters the data based on selected features and compares it to the original distribution.
2.Uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm to perform clustering.
3.Applies clustering on the last two features of the Iris dataset.
4.Visualizes raw data and clustering results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
